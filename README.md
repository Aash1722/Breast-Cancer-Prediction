# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Logistic and Lasso regression models to predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) using the Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using logistic and lasso regression models. The goal is to evaluate model performance and choose the best approach for accurate classification.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

The dataset contains 569 observations and 11 variables (10 features + 1 target).
